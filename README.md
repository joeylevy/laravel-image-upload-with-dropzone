# laravel-image-upload-with-dropzone
entire upload plus dropzone. When you drag a new image over the existing image, it uploads and replaces the image automatically.


I want to upload an employee photo and resize it by dragging a new image over the existing one. I watched my HR try to do that when I released an app for him and realized the way he wanted to do it was better.
